                  His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince
                  of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed
                  Forces, has a well-documented interest in sports, and in
                  particular, the martial art of Jiu-Jitsu. His Highness has the
                  ambition of making the UAE, and specifically Abu Dhabi, a
                  center for Jiu-Jitsu by designating it as the UAE National
                  Sport. His Highness believes that by practicing the art of
                  Jiu-Jitsu, people can change their mentality and take broad
                  strides towards a brighter and clearer direction. Having seen
                  the positive changes and the impact that Jiu-Jitsu has had on
                  his son’s character and attitude, His Highness says: “If I
                  invest it in my son, I will invest it in my country.”<br /><br />
                  His Highness recognized that local physical education programs
                  did not feature martial arts, and he took the initiative to
                  introduce a comprehensive Jiu-Jitsu program to public schools,
                  and other authority organizations across the emirate of Abu
                  Dhabi.
                  <br /><br />
                  Palms Sports was founded with a mandate to execute this
                  program to fulfill the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed
                  bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Palms Sports is now integrating mixed
                  martial arts into sports programs across UAE.
